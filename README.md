## Website that calls on the Google Maps API to allow users to search for their next holiday destination

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my second Milestone Project for The Code Institute.
I have chosen to create a website for a Travel Agency which I gave it the fictional brand name of "Quo Vado Destinations" (QVD). To create this project I've putted into practice skills and techniques developed and learnt during my learning journey so far. The technologies used are HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery.

The project is easy to navigate and fully responsive:it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes.

## UX â€“ User Experience

### The who?
The website purpose is to help users to find their next holiday destination, displaying catchy offers and showcasing the offered places. 

### The what?
What users want to achieve navigating the website is to find a travel destination among the ones offered by QVD.

### The how?
Users can find their next holiday destination directly choosing a package from the bucket list or by finding out about other destination directly searching on the google maps. 

## User Stories
